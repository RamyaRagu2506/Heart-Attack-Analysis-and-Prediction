3. If you want, try to play with the data
4. segregate the Features and labels respectively. 
5. Instantiate the model given 
6. split the data into training and test set
7. Fit the model with the Feature set and label set (from the data u had split munadi)
8. Predict the test set
9. build the confusion matrix
10. Show the classification report (You can check on google, or ping me, naan solren enadhu. ) - Instead of precision, recall and accuracy

Note: Use proper variables and do it slowly, no hurries, do one algorithm, eat, relax, watch tv or play something u wish, again do it!
